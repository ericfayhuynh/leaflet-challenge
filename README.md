# USGS Earthquake Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

Hello! I'm Eric, and I've developed this interactive dashboard to visualize the earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This tool allows users to explore seismic activity across the globe, highlighting the magnitude and depth of various earthquakes.

## Features

This dashboard is equipped with several interactive elements:

- **World Map Visualization**: Displays all earthquakes from the USGS dataset with markers.
- **Marker Size and Color**: Reflects the earthquake's magnitude and depth, providing an immediate visual cue of the earthquake's severity.
- **Information Popups**: Users can click on any marker to get detailed information about the earthquake, such as location, depth, and magnitude.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for webpage structure and design.
- JavaScript for interactive functionalities.
- Leaflet.js for map rendering.
- D3.js for handling the earthquake data.

## How to Use

Upon loading the dashboard, all recent earthquakes will be plotted on the map. You can interact with each marker to get more details about the earthquake. The legend on the bottom right provides information about the color coding relative to the earthquake's depth.

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the dashboard.

## Deployment

The dashboard has been deployed for public access. You can view the live dashboard [here](<link-to-your-deployed-dashboard>).


## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the USGS for providing the data that powers this dashboard. My gratitude also extends to the instructors and TAs at the UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Bootcamp for their support and guidance.
